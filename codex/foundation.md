## Target Personas

### 1. Founding CEO / COO

- **Daily Reality:** Racing to hit milestones before runway runs out
- **Psychology:** Overwhelmed, optimistic but pragmatic, constantly context-switching
- **Core Pain:** Team spends hours wrangling sales call data, still misses insights for product/marketing
- **Desired Outcome:** Growth loops that compound without extra headcount

### 2. Head of Sales / RevOps

- **Daily Reality:** Targets rising, data scattered
- **Psychology:** Target-driven, impatient for results, fiercely protective of reps' time
- **Core Pain:** Follow-ups slip, call nuggets die in recordings, reps write their own notes differently
- **Desired Outcome:** Pipeline auto-updates, insight auto-routes, deals close faster

### 3. Head of Product / Engineering Lead

- **Daily Reality:** Feature backlog vs. customer feedback firehose
- **Psychology:** Strategic, analytical, desperate for genuine customer signal amidst noise
- **Core Pain:** No clean, real-time feed of customer pain straight from calls
- **Desired Outcome:** Ship features based on live, structured voice-of-customer data

---

## Emotional Hooks

- **Primary:** You’re moving fast, but not fast enough
- **Supporting:**
  - Every conversation compounds—turn calls into intelligence, content, and closed deals
  - While you're manually pulling reports, your competitors are already acting on insights
  - While your team updates spreadsheets, theirs are closing deals
  - You know AI could change everything, but who has time to figure it out?

---

## Pain Categories

### 1. Operational Drag — *Death by 1,000 Papercuts*

- Call intelligence trapped in recordings and never reaches product/marketing
- Ghost data hiding in CRM notes, call transcripts, support tickets
- Constant, soul-crushing manual data entry
- Broken handoffs between sales, product, and success
- Context-switch burnout across HubSpot, Jira, Stripe, spreadsheets

### 2. Strategic Blindness — *Flying Blind*

- Making roadmap decisions based on anecdotes, not data
- Not knowing which customers are at-risk of churning
- Revenue leakage from missed follow-ups and blind renewals
- Different tools show different numbers — untrusted data

### 3. Resource Scarcity — *We Can't Do It All*

- Can't afford a full-time $180k/year RevOps director
- Engineers too busy building core product for internal tools
- Ops "spaghetti" of brittle zaps & scripts that break every quarter
- DIY-AI paralysis over security, prompting, and evals

### 4. Competitive Fear — *Falling Behind*

- Fear of being outpaced by "AI-first" competitors
- Anxiety of shrinking runway and pressure to make every decision count
- Competitors know things faster and respond quicker
